WSColiPosteLetterService Client Library
=======================================

## Introduction

This library is a client for the SOAP 
[WSColiPosteLetterService](https://www.coliposte.fr/pro/docs/docutheque/divers/socolissimo/integrationwsshipping.pdf).

Access to the WSColiPosteLetterService must be contracted with "La Poste" beforehand or 
it will simply not work. Also, note that currently only the production mode is working.

Nb: The structure of this library is heavily inspired by the 
[PHPForce Soap Client](https://github.com/phpforce/soap-client).

## Usage

### Standalone

# see example in sample/index.php
```

### Symfony2
